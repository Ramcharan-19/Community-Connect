üåç Community Connect Initiative

I had the incredible opportunity to visit Jai Hind Public School, Thirumazhisai, as part of my "Community Connect" initiative. During this visit, I conducted interactive sessions to introduce school students to the fascinating world of technology and computer science. Here‚Äôs what the initiative involved:

Objective: To inspire young minds and spark their interest in technology, coding, and problem-solving.

Topics Covered:

Basics of Computer Science and Programming

Introduction to Python Programming

Hands-on coding exercises to build simple programs

The importance of technology in today‚Äôs world

Career opportunities in tech and how to get started

Impact: The sessions were designed to be interactive and engaging, encouraging students to ask questions, participate in activities, and explore their creativity through code. It was incredibly rewarding to see their curiosity and enthusiasm grow throughout the sessions.

This initiative was a step towards bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, empowering students with the skills and confidence to pursue careers in technology. I believe that education and mentorship can transform lives, and I‚Äôm committed to continuing such efforts in the future.
